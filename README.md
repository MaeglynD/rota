# rota

## Whats not included?
 - Page responsivity, I believe from my current code you can infer that writing a few media queries wouldn't be a problem
 - A whole range of test suites. I included one singular test for the vuex store for the same reason as above.

## How do I use it?
 - Click on the datepicker or any other buttons you see. You'll probably figure it out

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# run tests
$ npm run test

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
